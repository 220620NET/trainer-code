# git

Git is a version control system, to be more precise, it's a distributed version control system, meaning everybody as their own copy of the repository

Basically, git is a way for software devs to back up our work and collaborate with others

## source code
Source code is your program

## Repository
Git repository or repo is source code plus the history of changes you've made

## Basic Git Workflow

2. Add to the staging area
2a. a change so i can commit
3. Commit with a meaningful message (For future you and your teammates)
