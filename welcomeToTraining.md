### Aim of the Training
As we embark in this journey together, it is important to keep in mind the aim of this training. This training is designed to prepare you to work as a professional software developer in an enterprise level software. As such, our expectation is different from other educational settings you may have experienced in the prior. One is that we conduct this training in work setting.  Trainers not only act as the teacher of their cohorts, but we also perform managerial duties and should be considered a manager. Moreover, we emphasize developing soft skills as much as technical skills, so expect to see different activities designed to help you develop your soft skills.

### Attendance
During training, you are expected to be available and be present in our zoom meeting from 10AM - 6PM EST Monday through Friday. Lunch is from 1PM to 2PM EST.

Attendance to these meetings are not optional and too many unexcused absences will be escalated to HR. For any circumstances that you have to miss the training for, such as medical appointment or illness, please let me know as soon as possible.

### Communication
It is pertinent to keep an open line of communication during and after the training. We are here to help you be successful and we cannot help if you don't communicate difficulties you're facing. 

Email will be our official method of communication. Please check your revature email frequently. We will also utilize other unofficial ways such as discord but sensitive information should not be shared on the discord server.

### Professionalism
Professionalism and respect go both ways. Let's respect each other so we can create and foster a safe and friendly working environment
- Please respect each other's time. Consistent tardiness will not be tolerated.
- No hate or discriminatory speech
- Use professional languages and address others professionally
- Follow the company policy, especially regarding dress code, behavior, etc.

#### Zoom Etiquette
Because we conduct our training virtually, there are additional etiquettes to be observed in zoom meetings
- Have your display name be your preferred first and last name
- Make sure your background is neat and professional. Either use a virtual background or make sure what we see behind you is not a mess.
- Camera must be on during QC and presentations
- Mute yourself if not speaking
- Do not enter my breakout room without getting my permission as it can violate others' privacy. And that includes even if I appear to be alone in the room. 

## What to Expect During Training 
Training consists of many different activities that aim to develop the skill set needed to become a successful developer. Such activities include lecture/demo, hackerrank challenges, QC (mock interviews and coding evaluations), presentations, quizzes, and individual and group projects.

### Projects
In training, we have 3 projects that are due on various weeks to practice the concepts and technologies we're learning. For each project, you'll present your project with a demo to showcase your project to your colleagues and me.

### Reporting
Occasionally you'll be asked to research on a topic and give a presentation on the topic to rest of the class. Take this as an opportunity to practice your research skills as well as a chance to hone your communication skills.

### Hackerrank Challenges
Coding isn't just about learning the technologies and knowing how to use them. Big part of coding is also knowing how to approach a problem and come up with working solutions. This tests a developer's problem solving skills as well as their creativity. We'll solve hackerrank questions to develop this skill as well as to prepare for any possible coding interviews.

### Evaluations
Every week there will be an assortment of evaluations to check your understanding of the topic discussed in the weeks prior. Take these evaluation as the opportunity to identify your weak spots in your conceptual and technical understanding.

These evaluation tend to occur on the beginning of the week, but do note that the schedule may change and please be flexible with us as we schedule them.

#### QC: Mock Interview
The QC team handles this particular evaluation which is aimed to help you practice answering technical interview questions in interview-like settings. The list of topics will be announced the week prior, but expect it to cover all topics that were covered between the last QC and the upcoming one. Refer to Revature Pro curriculum for all topics that may be on the table. You are expected to study the topics that is listed on Revature Pro's curriculum, regardless of whether we spent time during training covering those topics or not.

#### QC: Coding Evaluation
This particular evaluation tests your technical ability in coding interview settings. We'll be using iMocha and hackerrank to assess how well you translate word problems into working solutions. Expect to be given about 20 minutes per question, and you'll be allowed access to the official documentation during the evaluation.

### One on One's
There will be check in meetings with each of you. This will give us a chance to discuss how you are doing in the training and any support or resource I can give to help you get the most out of the training. Feel free to bring any questions/comments/concerns you have to these!
