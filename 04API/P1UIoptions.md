# P1 Above and Beyond Options (*optional*)

## UI
The mandatory requirement for P1 is that you have Web API (aka Backend) for Expense Reimbursement System. However, if you wish, you can implement/build an UI for it.

1. Use Console Application to make HTTP calls to your backend
    - Your console application should not have any knowledge of Services and DataAccess layer logic.
    - It has to have reference to your Model class, but the core functionality of the app has to come from your backend
    - Use HttpClient class to make http calls.

2. (even more optional) If you have prior knowledge on any web frontend technology such as html, css, js, react, angular etc, feel free to use them to create ui.
    - for vanilla js, use FetchAPI to make http calls
