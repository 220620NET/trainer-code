# Guessing Game Instruction
- Build a game that will randomly generate a number between 0 and 100
- Ask the user to guess the number within a certain # of tries
- Then tell the user whether their guess was high, or low
- If the user's guess was right, then end the game

- Optionally, you can add the following feature
    1. Tell if the user's guess is hot, warm, lukewarm, cold, freezing
    2. Save the history of their guesses, and tell them if they're getting hotter or colder
    3. Leaderboard
