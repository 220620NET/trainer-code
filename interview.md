# Scope of interview
- should be limited to the role/job description
- tailor your answer to needs/job
- research (if available) interviewers, but at least the company

## common pitfalls/tips/tricks
- watch out for nervous habits
    - fidgeting
    - swiveling in chair
    - filler words
    - your gaze
- camera / camera angle
- background
- lighting
- screen background
- don't reveal all your hopes and dreams (they don't need to know)
- energy level/vocal tone/pacing (at the very least, show some engagement/enthusiasm for the role/opportunity)
- Watch out: They may not turn on their camera, be prepared for that.
- Remind yourself they're hiring because they need someone
- Keep answers simple, if you don't fully understand what question is, don't push yourself to explain more
- STAR Method

## Infosys interview patterns

- Their interviews tend to be very technical
    - Expect QC style questioning for ~45 minutes
    - Database (SQL)
        - SQL Query questions especially
    - C# 
        - OOP Pillars
        - SOLID Design Principles
- Project based questions
- Scenario based problem solving question
- Do NOT take notes during interviews

## Project Based Questions
- Do not use terms P1, P2, P3, instead give description of the project
- Describe the project as if they don't know anything about it (because they really don't) and a short overview tech stack
- Talk about your responsibilities and contributions
- Don't over inflate what you did

## STAR Strategy
This is a good tool to answer any kind of situational questions

## Tell Me About Yourself (TMAY)
- This is your elevator pitch about your PROFESSIONAL self
- Keep it short, brief, to the point 
- Avoid repeating your resume (they already have it in front of them)
- Highlight your career and talk about things that may not be apparent in your resume
- Your education (especially if it's relevant to the job)
- Your career/what led you to here
- How you qualify for this position
- casual but confident bluffing
- talk about the most relevant qualifications the most positive way without outright lying about it
